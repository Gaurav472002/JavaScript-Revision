<!--  Some famous API websites are github.users or randomuser.me
We can use the JSON Formatter to format the messy data recieved from the API and have a better understanding

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a group of related technologies used to display data asynchronously.

There are 5 ready states of a request in AJAX.

0 means UNOPENED
1 means OPENED
2 means HEADERS_RECEIVED
3 means LOADING
4 means DONE

Console.log or document are not part of the core javascript. Console.log is basically a debugging dev tool for our browsers.
It is injected by the runtime of the javascript. Node js is bascially an implementation of V8 engine using the c++ language.
Js actually runs via the c++. Js is basically a wrapper around c++ python also.
V8 engine provides access to this debugging tools and core functionalities.
The actual implementation of console.log is written here ----  https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/main/src/d8/d8-console.cc
