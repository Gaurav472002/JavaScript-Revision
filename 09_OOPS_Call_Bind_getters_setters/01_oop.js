// object literal denotes literally an object nothing else object is the basic unit in js

// object is basically a collection of properties and methods

// Yes, JavaScript has introduced class syntax as part of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). While [JavaScript is a prototype-based language],
//  the class syntax provides a more familiar and convenient way to define classes and create objects with a syntax similar to
//   other object-oriented programming languages.

// why use oop --> to avoid complex codes also known as messy or spaghetti code  

// this is a simple object
const user ={

    userName: "gaurav",
    loginCount :8,
    signedIn:true,

    getuseretails: function(){
        // console.log(`${username}`) // this will generate error because we haven't mentioned the execution context here
        //  about which  userName are we talking about
        console.log(`${this.userName}`) // this keyword is used to refer to the current context ki bhai is object  ka username batado
        console.log(this) // the current context will be printed here which is the current object user so here the current context is the whole object
    }
}

// suppose we create an array , the prototype of the array consists of the map and other methods as well. Suppose we crate another array
// So we have only one map function, how does this map function will know on which array it should operate?
// this problem is solved using the this keyword which represents the current context.
console.log(user.userName)
console.log(user["userName"]); // another way to get object properties
console.log(user.getuseretails()) 
console.log(this) // in the global context the current context will be empty object  {}

// but when we do the same in the browser then the current context stores the current [window object] which has a lot of properties

/* constructor ---> suppose we want to create another user named as user2 then we will have to copy paste the above code to
  avoid that repetitive task we will use constructors*/

//   example of construction function

// const date1 = new Date()
// const promise1 = new Promise()

// using this keyword to assign value to the function arguments

// The new keyword is used to create a new instance from the same object literal. We can create multiple instances  of the same object using new


// creating a constructor function

function User(userName,loginCount,signedIn){
    // userName=userName  this creates confusion

    // myUserName =userName ; // assigning value to my variable but  rather than this we will use the this keyword
    
    this.userName=userName
    this.loginCount=loginCount;
    this.signedIn=signedIn  // mere variable mei jo value function se arahi hai usko assign kardo
    
    // return this;    //--> this will return the whole object

    // this will work even without return because it happens implicitly

    // we can provide functions as well

    this.greeting =  function(){
        console.log("Good morning")
    }
}

// make new users using the constructor function

// const user1 = User("Gaurav",12,true)
// const user2 = User("Saurav",13,false) // this will overWrite the values of the user1 if we don't use the new key word.  
//TO resolve this we use the constructor function which provided a new instance eveytime using the new keyword

/* without the new keyword you will get undefined because the values will be set in the global execution context" */



const user1 =new User("Gaurav",12,true)
const user2 = new User("Saurav",13,false)

// we can use it using the new keyword which will provide a new instance for each object and 
//new keyword is responsible for calling the constructor function
console.log(user1)
console.log(user2)
console.log(user1.constructor) //  constructor is a reference to itself

console.log(user1 instanceof User)

/* when we use the new keyword an empty object is created . In the next step Constructor function is called due to [new] keyword 
 which packs the arguments inside the object. In the third step the arguments are injected into the this keyword and then 
 we get access in the function. */
