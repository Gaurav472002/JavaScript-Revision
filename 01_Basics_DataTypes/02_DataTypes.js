"use strict"; // treats all the code as the newer version of the javascript -- semicolon is important here

// Even if we don't mention the above line still many code editors used the default new version of javascript

// There is a lot of difference between the js which was written in books earlier and which is used in current industry

// All the syntax of js is defined by an international commitee called ECMA Standards

alert("hello"); // this will not work inside the node.js This only works in browsers

// There are generally 8 primitive dataTypes in JS

/*  number --> all numerical values
    string -->  "" or ''
    boolean --> true/false
    null -->   this is a standalone value which denotes value khali hai whose type is null
    undefined --> this means value defined hi nahi hai
    symbol -->  to denote unique data types
    bigInt
    object --> null is of type object*/

/* we can use null to represent we got nothing like if we fetch data from a server and we got nothing then we can represent it using null */

//  when to use (semicolon); ? When we want to write code in the same line 

// try to write code in different lines as well this style of coding is not recommended at all
console.log(3+3) ; console.log("Gaurav")

// original documentation of Javascript is available at tc39.es is available here all the standards are defined here

// dataTypes in JS

let name = "Gaurav"
let age =   18
let loggedIn = true;
// type of null is object
console.log(typeof null)
console.log(typeof undefined) // type of undefined is undefined
