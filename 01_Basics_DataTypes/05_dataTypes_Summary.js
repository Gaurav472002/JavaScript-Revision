/* -------------------------- MEMORY MANAGEMENT IN JS --------------------------------*/

/* Stack memory is used by all of the (Primitive DataTypes) and Heap memory is used by all of the (Non Primitve Datatypes)

In Stack memory ----> we get a copy of variables
In Heap Memory we get reference to the values if we change values the changes will be reflected in original places.

let oldName ="Gaurav";
let newName =oldName
console.log(newName)

console.log(oldName)

// so when the newName is assigned to the oldName a copy of oldName is given to the newName so as a result when change is made in  
//the newName , oldName remains same because changes we made in the copy not in  the original variable

// SO we can say that the primitive data types are immutable where as the non-primitive data types are mutable
