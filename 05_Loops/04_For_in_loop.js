// for of loops doesn't works for objects  that's why we use for in loops

for (const key in languages) {
//    console.log(key); // this will only print the keys

//    console.log(languages[key])// this will print the corresponding values of the key

    console.log(`${key} -->  ${languages[key]}`) // this will print the key value pairs
}

// the for in loops is not only designed for the objects it works with other ds as well but differently

let myArray =["cat","dog","elephant","Lion"]

for (const key in myArray) {
   console.log(key); // this will print the indices of the array which are called keys

   console.log(myArray[key]); // this will print the values of the array
}

// arrays keys starts from 0 that's why objects were designed so that we can set the indices anyhow we want

// the maps are not iterable by the for in loops


/******* FOR IN LOOPS DOESNT WORKS FOR MAPS ******** */

// to iterate maps use the for of loop
const map = new Map()
map.set('In',"India")
map.set('Fr',"France")
map.set('Afr',"Africa")

for (const key in map) {
    console.log(key); // nothing will be printed we will not get error here
